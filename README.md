## Background
Research tools are essential for conducting effective research, as they provide researchers with the necessary resources and methods to collect, analyze, and interpret data. The use of research tools allows for accurate and reliable results, promotes efficient data collection, and enables researchers to draw meaningful conclusions from their findings.

## Problem Statement

No matter what career field you’re in, there’s always more to learn. Research unlocks the unknowns and fuels a deeper understanding.
Reports state that 90% of ideas fail because of lackof research. Infact, Research is pretty much thebase of every hackathon project. Nowadays for most researchers, the process of reading and finding papers has become extremely tedious and time-consuming.

What is SAVANT ? (We took the name, from Savant Syndrome in the series , Good Doctor ;)

## Challenges we ran into

- The key challenge in the project was implementing the collaborative workspaces. 
- Creating workspaces and having multiple users join them using codes was a difficult task. 
- Integrating various third-party libraries and APIs with the project was a challenging task as e dealt with deprecated versions and compatibility issues. - Implementing features like the in-browser PDF viewer and PDF annotator was quite a daunting task. Also, we had to build a customised model for performing PDF summarisation.
